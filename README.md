# WaterJugChallenge

Run instructions:

You need: 
  - xCode 13.2.1+
  - MacOS Monterrey
  - iOS Simulators of iPhone (I Use iPhone X simulator and a Physics iPhone XR with iOS 14.6)

Steps:
	
  - Open the project
  - Select device an run


Notes:

	- I see that UIPicketView fail in fast scroll gestures on Simulators to get the visual number; but this is not the case in the real iPhone X iOS 14.6
	- Unit Testing Coverage: 76% of all the project, 94.7% of the no visual part and 66.5% of visual parts :)
